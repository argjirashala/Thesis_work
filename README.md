This thesis introduces the development of a Patient Management Web Application, aimed at tackling long-standing challenges in managing healthcare records. 
This application is a complete system that changes the way healthcare providers and patients handle medical records. 
The point of this thesis is the combination of healthcare and technology, and how digital tools can improve medical practices. 
The Patient Management Web Application is carefully designed and built, using React.js for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end, ensuring the application is responsive, secure, and 
adaptable to different users' needs.
This work explores different aspects of healthcare management from the viewpoints of doctors, patients, and administrative staff. 
This application makes record-keeping more efficient, simplifies appointment scheduling, and allows for real-time access to patient data. This leads to a more 
cooperative and well-informed approach to healthcare.
